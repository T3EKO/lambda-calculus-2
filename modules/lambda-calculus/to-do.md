## To Do
- cache constant values instead of calculating every frame
- all rendering steps can access transparent fade-out layer
- sub-expression coloring
- sub-expression colors mix in reduction animation
- export sub-sections of long animations into one zip instead of individual zips
- animation post-processor that dynamically resizes view to width of current expression

## Done
- better rendering method
- animations for top-level reductions
- animations for reductions inside a big expression
